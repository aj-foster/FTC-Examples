# Contributing to FTC Examples

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the FTC Examples repository. Before you jump in, please consider these few points:

* Examples in this repository are meant for everyone to use. The code will be MIT licensed, so don't contribute anything you wish to remain secret, hidden, or unused by others.
* This repository is a learning resource, so we want to present examples in a friendly, welcoming manner. Instructive code comments and simple examples are preferred.
* Communication or contributions that place any party — a team, an organization, or another contributor — in a negative light are unwelcome. The repository maintainers reserve the right to decline contributions from individuals who don't demonstrate FIRST's values of *Gracious Professionalism*.

With all that said, please feel free to create a Pull Request and contribute examples. Though the maintainers may choose to make changes, we appreciate your time and effort.
